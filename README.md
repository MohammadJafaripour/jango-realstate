#  BT Real Estate - Django Application

> A fully functional real estate application built with Django, converted from a static Bootstrap 4 theme into a dynamic web platform.

##  About The Project

This repository contains the source code for a practical real estate application built based on requirements from a fictional company. The goal of this project was to take a raw HTML/CSS/Bootstrap 4 theme and transform it into a robust application capable of handling real-world data and user interactions.

The application allows users to browse property listings, view realtor details, and submit inquiries. It features a powerful custom backend to manage all resources efficiently.

* **Inquiry System:** Contact forms for specific listings that save inquiries to the database for realtor follow-up.
* **Admin Dashboard:** customized Django Admin area to manage:
* Property Listings (publish/unpublish, add photos, prices, etc.)
* Realtors (add/remove agents, contact info)
* Contact Inquiries (view messages from potential buyers)


* **User Accounts:** User registration, login, and dashboard to view inquiry history.
* **Responsive Design:** specific implementation of Bootstrap 4 for mobile-friendly browsing.

##  Technologies Used

* **Backend Framework:** Python / Django
